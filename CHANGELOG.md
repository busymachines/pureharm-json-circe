### :warning: Breaking changes

- offer implicit circe decoders only for `RefinedTypeThrow[O, N]` instead of `RefinedType[O, N, E]`. This is part of a larger decision that pureharm simply uses Throwable subtypes for errors. The support for the generic version also tripped up end users that didn't have a `Show[Throwable]` instance in scope.

### Deprecations

- all `unsafe` syntax extensions are now deprecated. Will be removed in `0.3.0`. Just throw exceptions in the few places in client code where necessary.

### New Scala versions:

- 2.13 for JS platform

### Dependency upgrades:

- [pureharm-core-anomaly](https://github.com/pureharm-core/releases) `0.2.0`
- [pureharm-core-sprout](https://github.com/busymachines/pureharm-core/releases) `0.2.0`
