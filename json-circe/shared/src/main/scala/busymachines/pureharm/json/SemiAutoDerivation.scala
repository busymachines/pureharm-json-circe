Deriving decoders in pureharm style can run into one of the several problems:
   1) if your case class has any Sprout/Sub[T] for any T, then make sure you have an Decoder (xor Codec) for T, AND the PureharmJsonImplicits in scope, usually by mixing that trait into your myapp.json.implicits._ and importing it.
   _
   2) if your case class has some field of type SproutRefined/Sub[E, T], you need to have a Show[E] for its error, since circe uses Strings for errors.
   _
   3) Make sure you have one, and only one io.circe.generic.extras.Configuration in scope. In pureharm, this is usually brought int in by mixing in PureharmJsonImplicits into your myapp.json.implicits package.
   _
   4) As usual for circe, make sure you have in scope Decoder (xor Codec) for any type that is not a case class. To debug write step by step explicit implicits for your case class field types w/ stubs until you narrow down your problem, eg:
      case class F(f1: F1, f2: F2)
      _
      import myapp.json.implcits._
      val decoderF = derive.decoder[F] //fails
      _
      to debug:
      implicit val tempf1Decoder: Decoder[F1] = ???
      val decoderF = derive.decoder[F] //if it works now, you know F1 didn't have a decoder, your turn to find it.
      _
      Usually, using stuff from the following things trip people up since they don't have defaults:
        a) types java.time._
        b) java.util.UUID
    5) when deriving a sealed trait, make sure all subtypes are a product, or provide Decoder (xor Codec) for such subtypes
